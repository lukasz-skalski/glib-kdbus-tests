= Description =
===============

This test application is part of GLib-kdbus (GLib library with kdbus
transport) development process. The most important tasks in new
transport implementation are:

* low-level support for kdbus,

* support for two new bus types called "user" and "machine",

* new library API for common tasks such as fetching the list of name
  owners on the bus, checking sender's PID, ..., (because it is not
  permitted to make calls to the org.freedesktop.DBus destination on
  the new bus types),

This test application allows you test all above new features. More info
about GLib-kdbus project status and new API for kdbus pruposes you can
find here:
